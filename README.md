> TinyGo is a new compiler for an existing programming language, the Go
> programming language. TinyGo focuses on compiling code written in Go, but for
> smaller kinds of systems:
>
> - The Go compiler and tools (from golang.org) are the reference implementation
>   of the Go programming language. They are primarily intended for server side
>   programming but also used for command line tools and other purposes.
> - The TinyGo project implements the exact same programming language. However,
>   TinyGo uses a different compiler and tools to make it suited for embedded
>   systems and WebAssembly. It does this primarily by creating much smaller
>   binaries and targeting a much wider variety of systems.

&mdash; [Overview | TinyGo](https://tinygo.org/getting-started/overview/)

This Dev Container Feature will install TinyGo using the official `.deb` from
the [TinyGo Releases page]. You are then able to use `tinygo` as normal! This
Feature will also auto-install the [TinyGo VS Code extension] and the official
[Golang VS Code extension]. Happy Gophering! üêø
